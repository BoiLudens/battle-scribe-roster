**++ Roster Rules ++**


. **Dynastic Agents and Star Gods:** DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units can be included in a NECRONS detachment without preventing other units in that Detachment from gaining a Dynastic Code. DYNASTIC AGENT and C'TAN SHARD units never gain a Dynastic Code.  You can include a maximum of one C'TAN SHARD model in each NECRONS Detachment in your army. (Codex: Necrons p51)

. **The Royal Court:** When mustering your army, if it contains THE SILENT KING model, that model must be selected as your WARLORD. Otherwise, if your army contains a PHAERON model, that model must be selected as your WARLORD. Otherwise, if your army caontains an OVERLORD model, that model must be selected as your WARLORD. Otherwise, if your army contains a LORD model, that model must be selected as your WARLORD. If your army contains none of the listed models, select your WARLORD as normal. (Codex: Necrons p51)

&nbsp;

**++ Selection Rules ++**


. **Command Protocols:** If every unit from your army (excluding DYNASTIC AGENT, C'TAN SHARD and UNALIGNED units) is from the same dynasty, and you select a NOBLE model to be your WARLORD, this unit is eligible to benefit from this ability and the following rules apply.  

After both sides have deployed, but before you have determined who will have the first turn, you must assign a different one of the command protocols to each of the first five battle rounds, and note this down secretly on your army roster.

At the start of each battle round, if any NOBLE units from your army are on the battlefield, the command protocol that you assigned to that battle round becomes active for your army until the end of that battle round. Each command protocol is made up of two directives. When a command protocol becomes active for your army, reveal it to your opponent and select one of its directives. Until the assigned command protocol stops being active, while a unit that is eligible to benefit from this ability is within 6" of a friendly NECRONS CHARACTER model (excluding C'TAN SHARD models), that unit benefits from the selected directive.

If the battle lasts for more than five battle rounds, then until the end of the battle, whichever command protocol was active in the fifth battle round remains active. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Conquering Tyrant:** 
Directive 1: Add 3" to the range of this unit's aura abilities (to a maximum of 12") and increase the range of the following abilities this unit has by 3" (to a maximum of 12"): Lord's Will, My Will Be Done, Rites of Reanimation.

Directive 2: This unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Fell Back, but if it does, then until the end of the turn, each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, subtract 1 from that attack's hit roll. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Eternal Guardian:** 
Directive 1: Each time an attack is made against this unit, if it did not make a Normal Move, Advance or Fall Back this battle round, this unit receives the benefit of Light cover, as described in the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book.

Directive 2: Each time an enemy unit declares a charge against this unit, if this unit is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can either Hold Steady or Set to Defend. 
-If it Holds Steady, then until the end of the phase, any Overwatch attacks made by models in that unit score hits on unmodified rolls of 5+ instead of 6. 
-If it Sets to Defend, then until the end of the phase, it cannot fire Overwatch, but until the end of the next Fight phase, each time a model in that unit makes a melee attack, add 1 to that attack's hit roll. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Hungry Void:** 
Directive 1: Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack, on an unmodified wound roll of 6, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1

Directive 2: Each time a model in this unit makes a melee attack, if this unit made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, add 1 to that attack's Strength characteristic. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Sudden Storm:** 
Directive 1: Add 1" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.

Directive 2: If this unit is performing an action, it can still make attacks with ranged weapons without that action failing. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Undying Legions:** 
Directive 1: Each time this unit uses its Living Metal ability, each model in this unit regains 1 additional lost wound.

Directive 2: Each time you make Reanimation Protocol rolls for this unit, you can re-roll one of the dice. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Command Protocols - Protocol of the Vengeful Stars:** 
Directive 1: Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, on an unmodified wound roll of 6, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

Directive 2: Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack that targets a unit within half range, the target does not receive the benefits of cover to its saving throw against that attack. (Codex: Necrons p81)

. **Living Metal:** At the start of your Command phase, each model in this unit regains 1 lost wound. (Codex: Necrons p80)

. **Objective Secured:** A player controls an objective marker if they have any models with this ability within range of that objective marker, even if there are more enemy models within range of that objective marker. If an enemy model within range of an objective marker also has this ability (or a similar ability), then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range of that objective marker as normal. (Warhammer 40,000 Core Book p237)

. **Powers of the C'tan (Instructions):** Before the battle, generate the Powers of the C'tan for C'TAN SHARD units from your army using the table below. You can either roll one D6 to generate each power randomly (re-rolling duplicate results), or you can select which powers each unit knows. If selecting powers, a power cannot be selected for a second time until all other powers have been selected at least once by units in your army, and no unit can know the same power more than once. Write down any Powers of the C'tan your units know on your army roster.

1) Antimatter Meteor
2) Time's Arrow
3) Sky of Falling Stars
4) Cosmic Fire
5) Seismic Assault
6) Transdimensional Thunderbolt (Codex: Necrons p68)

. **Reanimation Protocols:** Each time an enemy unit shoots or fights, after it makes its attacks, if any models in this unit were destroyed as a result of those attacks but this unit was not destroyed, this unit's reanimation protocols are enacted and those destroyed models begin to reassemble.

Each time a unit's reanimation protocols are enacted, make Reanimation Protocol rolls for that unit by rolling a number of D6 equal to the combined Wounds characteristics of all the reassembling models. Each Reanimation Protocol roll of 5+ is put into a pool. A Reanimation Protocol roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

If the number of dice in that pool is greater than or equal to the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models, select one of those models to be Reanimated. A Reanimated model:
	-Is added back to its unit with its full wounds remaining.
	-Can only set up within Engagement Range of enemy units that are already within Engagement Range of the Reanimated model's unit.
	-Cannot, if it is your Charge phase, be set up closer to any enemy units that are targets of a charge declared by its unit this phase.
	-No longer counts as having been destroyed for the purposes of Morale tests this turn.

You then reduce the number of dice in that pool by a number equal to the Wounds characteristic of the Reanimated model and repeat this process until either there are no more reassembling models, or the number of dice remaining in the pool is less than the Wounds characteristic of any of the reassembling models. Any models that did not Reanimate fail to reassemble, and any dice remaining in the pool are discarded. (Codex: Necrons p80)

. **Secondary Objective - Ancient Machineries:** 
Shadow Operations Objective: If you selected this secondary objective, then after both sides have finished deploying, starting with your opponent, the players
alternate selecting objective markers that are not within any player’s deployment zone to be Ancient Machinery objective markers, until three objective markers have been selected (if there are only one or two such objective markers, then only those objective markers are Ancient Machinery objective markers).

NECRONS CORE or NECRONS CANOPTEK units from your army can attempt the following action:

Awaken Ancient Machinery (Action): At the end of your Movement phase, one or more NECRONS CORE or NECRONS CANOPTEK units from your army can start to perform this action. Each unit from your army that starts to perform this action must be in range of a different Ancient Machinery objective marker. A unit cannot start this action while there are any enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT) in range of the same objective marker. The action is completed at the end of your next Command phase, provided the unit attempting the action is still within range of that Ancient Machinery objective marker.

Score 3 victory points each time a unit from your army completes the Awaken Ancient Machinery action. (Codex: Necrons p69(e))

. **Secondary Objective - Code of Combat:** 
No Mercy, No Respite Objective: Score 3 victory points at the end of the battle for each enemy unit that was destroyed by a NECRONS NOBLE unit from your army. (Codex: Necrons p69)

. **Secondary Objective - Purge the Vermin:** 
Battlefield Supremacy Objective: Score 2 victory points at the end of your turn for each table quarter that does not have any enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT units) wholly within it. This objective cannot be scored in the first battle round. (Codex: Necrons p69)

. **Secondary Objective - The Treasures of Aeons:** 
Battlefield Supremacy Objective: If you selected this secondary objective, then after both sides have finished deploying, your opponent selects 3 objective markers on the battlefield. Score a number of victory points at the end of your turn if you control one or more of those objective markers, as shown in the table below:

1 Marker(s): 2 Points
2 Marker(s): 3 Points
3 Marker(s): 5 Points (Codex: Necrons p69)
